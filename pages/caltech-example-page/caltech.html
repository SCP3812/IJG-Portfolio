        Last summer, I had the fantastic opportunity to do an internship with Caltech at one of their biological research laboratories. I was ecstatic about starting it; it would be the first time I would have ever stepped into a wet lab (not including the labs at my school, of course). On the actual in-person first day, the Grad student I was working under had begun to show me the hoops of the lab, the autoclave, the disinfectant procedures, the difference between different growth solutions, etc., and I was also shown the quirk of this particular lab; working with fruit flies.

        Aside from being an interesting parallel to human life, these flies were part of my work in the lab. Specifically, I was assigned to perform an experiment seeking to test the effects of bacteria harvested from yogurt on the flies ornithine levels (a specific amino acid, associated with protein formation).  <br />
        <br />
        This experiment involved growing the yogurt bacteria themselves in a specialized growth medium, then purifying the bacterial sludge and feeding it to the flies, then homogenizing the flies and testing the ornithine levels with a specialized assay.

      <p class="section-body">
        I finally put my findings into a presentation, and presented it to a fairly large audience towards the end of my internship tenure.
